# Graph Calculator

No not **graphing** calculator like [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator),
but a graph based calculator there your operations are nodes and edges are numbers.

Think 'visual shader editor' just, like, a million times simpler.

## Why

### Even at all

It's a cool project that incorporates a few need elements and it might be useful
for other things in the future.

### Why web based

UI is easy... and I'd like to host it. Besides it easy to port with stuff like
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
